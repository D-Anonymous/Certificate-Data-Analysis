**Introduction**
This notebook provides a template for data analysis using Google Colab. The notebook walks through the steps of:

**Uploading a Google Sheet from Google Drive.**
**Performing data cleaning.**
**Conducting a linear regression analysis.**
This notebook will be a reference, so please feel free to revisit it anytime.

For this workbook, we'll be using the Movies dataset.

Below are explanations for R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

**R-squared (R²)**

What is R-squared? R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent (target) variable that is predictable from the independent (predictor) variables. In simpler terms, it tells you how well your model explains the variability of the target variable based on the input features.

**How to Interpret R-squared?**

R-squared = 1: The model perfectly explains all the variability of the target variable. This is the ideal scenario, but it's rare in practice.
R-squared = 0: The model does not explain any of the variability of the target variable. This means the model fails to capture the relationship between the predictors and the target.
R-squared between 0 and 1: The model explains a certain percentage of the variability. For example, an R-squared of 0.75 means that the model can explain 75% of the variability in the target variable, while the remaining 25% is unexplained.
Why is R-squared Important? R-squared gives you an idea of the goodness of fit of your model. A higher R-squared value generally indicates a better fit, but it’s important to note that a very high R-squared might also suggest overfitting, especially in complex models.

**Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
What is Mean Squared Error? Mean Squared Error (MSE) measures the average squared difference between the actual values and the values predicted by your model. It calculates the error by taking the difference between each actual and predicted value, squaring it, and then averaging these squared differences.

**How to Interpret MSE?**

Lower MSE: Indicates that the model’s predictions are closer to the actual values, meaning the model is performing well.
Higher MSE: Suggests that the predictions are far from the actual values, meaning the model may not be capturing the underlying relationship well.
Why is MSE Important? MSE gives you a sense of the accuracy of your model’s predictions. Since it squares the differences between actual and predicted values, it penalizes larger errors more heavily, making it a sensitive measure of model performance. However, it’s important to remember that MSE is in the units of the target variable squared, which can make interpretation tricky if you're comparing models or datasets.

**Key Difference Between MSE and R-squared:**

MSE is an absolute measure of prediction error in the original units of the target variable.
R-squared is a relative measure that tells you the proportion of variance explained by the model.
Both R-squared and MSE are critical metrics for evaluating the performance of a linear regression model, and together they provide a comprehensive picture of how well your model is doing.
